# Data Science
Projects related to machine learning, deep learning, etc.

1. **House price prediction** - Model to predict the price of house given its year of sale, age, location, etc. Implemented dense neural netowrk with three hidden layers and output layer. Used *tensorflow (keras)* framework with *adadelta optimizer* and *earlystopping callback*.

1. **Basic image classification** - Model to classify the input images of handwritten numbers (MNIST) from 0 to 9. Implemented dense neural network with two hidden layers and output layer. Used *tensorflow (keras)* framework with *sochastic gradient descent* and *one hot encoding*.

1. **Linear Regression with Numpy** - Model to apply *linear regression* to map n input features to output using *numpy*. Used *gradient descent* and implemented propagation and optimization from scratch.

1. **Image classification CNNs with Keras** - Model to apply *convolutional neural networks* to classify images into three classes (can be extended to any number of classes) using *keras*. Used *adam optimizer* and created *convolution, maxpooling and fully connected layers*. Also applied *batch normalisation* and *dropout regularization*.

1. **Traffic light classification** - Model to apply *convolutional neural networks* to classify 43 types of traffic signs using *keras*. Used *adam optimizer* and created *convolution, averagepooling and fully connected layers*. Also applied *dropout regularization*.
