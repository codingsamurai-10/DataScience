Projects related to machine learning, deep learning, etc.

1. **House price prediction** - Model to predict the price of house given its year of sale, age, location, etc. Implemented dense neural netowrk with three hidden layers and output layer. Used *tensorflow (keras)* framework with *adadelta optimizer* and *earlystopping callback*.

1. **Basic image classification** - Model to classify the input images of handwritten numbers (MNIST) from 0 to 9. Implemented dense neural network with two hidden layers and output layer. Used *tensorflow (keras)* framework with *sochastic gradient descent* and *one hot encoding*.

1. **Linear Regression with Numpy** - Model to apply linear regression to map n input features to output using numpy. Used gradient descent and implemented propagation and optimization from scratch.
