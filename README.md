Projects related to machine learning, deep learning, etc.

1. **House price prediction** - Model to predict the price of house given its year of sale, age, location, etc. Implemented dense neural netowrk with three hidden layers and output layer. Used tensorflow (keras) framework with adam optimizer and earlystopping callback.

1. **Basic image classification** - Model to classify the input images of handwritten numbers (MNIST) from 0 to 9. Implemented dense neural network with two hidden layers and output layer. Used tensorflow (keras) framework with sochastic gradient descent.
